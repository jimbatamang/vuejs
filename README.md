# Vuejs Practices
## tasks.html
In this practice session, I'm trying to achieve following:
- There are three columns: "All Tasks", "In Progress" and "Completed" 
- Able to add new tasks to "All Tasks" via input field
- Can send any tasks to "In Progress" column
- Can send any "In Progress" tasks to "Completed" column
